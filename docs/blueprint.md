- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F5), almost white, for a clean and modern look, focusing attention on the content.
- Accent color: Light rose (#E997FA), contrasting subtly with the violet, can highlight interactive elements and CTAs.
- Body text and headlines: Use 'Literata' (serif) for its vintage, literary feel, offering readability and a touch of class to the long-form content.
- Sections clearly divided using contrasting background shades or borders to distinguish each section. Content centered to provide focus.
- Subtle fade transitions between slides in the image carousel. Smooth number incrementing animation in the time counter to indicate its real-time nature.
